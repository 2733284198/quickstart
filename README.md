Getting started with FirePHP 1.0
================================

*Version: v0.1.0*

*Stability: dev*

This project contains everything you need to get started with [FirePHP 1.0](http://docs.sourcemint.org/firephp.org/1).

FirePHP is an advanced logging system that can display PHP variables in the browser as an application is navigated.
All communication is out of band to the application meaning that the logging data will not interfere with the normal functioning of the application.

You can install this project to:

  * Expore all FirePHP features with examples from popular open source projects
  * Learn how to install and configure FirePHP by example
  * Learn how to integrate FirePHP into frameworks by example
  * Learn how to integrate FirePHP into applications by example

All examples are intended to be explored together with the official FirePHP 1.0 documentation at:
[http://docs.sourcemint.org/firephp.org/1](http://docs.sourcemint.org/firephp.org/1)

NOTE: This project is a work in progress and contributions are welcome.

Assuming:

  * You are running [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) or equivalent (in terms of URL rewrite support via `.htaccess` files)
  * You are running [PHP 5.3+](http://php.net/)
  * `/root/` is your document root
  * `http://localhost/` is mapped to your `/root/`

Via manual download and extraction:

  2. Click on the *Downloads* button and download the `.zip` archive
  3. When downloaded extract the archive to `/root/`
  4. Open `/root/` in a project or file explorer so you can launch files to view
  5. Browse to `http://localhost/` using [Firefox 4+](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/). You should see a welcome page.

On a UNIX system with `git` installed:

    cd /root/
    git clone git://github.com/firephp/quickstart.git .
